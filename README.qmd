# Assessing the performance of spatial cross-validation approaches for models of spatially structured data

This repository contains the code and files necessary to create the paper "[Assessing the performance of spatial cross-validation approaches for models of spatially structured data](./paper_outputs/spatial_cv_arxiv.pdf)", hopefully published in 2023. 

The project is structured to use the [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) package. You can reconstruct any step of the project via `targets::tar_make()`. Note that the simulations will take a few weeks to run on a standard computer.

The paper itself is a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) document, saved as the [paper.qmd](./paper.qmd) file. 

This repository is structured as follows:
